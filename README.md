In this, I have tried to make use of gpt model So that you can make changes in the code using the CLI only and also can get the response of gpt model to what is happening and what is required to do.

1. To run on your device, u need to have any gemini gpt api key which will go in the .env file
2. download the uv(https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) project manager.
3. run python main.py "what u want to do"
